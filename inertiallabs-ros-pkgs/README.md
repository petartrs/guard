The `inertiallabs_ros_pkgs` package is a linux ROS driver for GPS-Aided Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), IMU-P ,AHRS and AHRS-10 of [Inertial Labs](https://inertiallabs.com/). The package is developed based on the official [SDK v0.2](https://gitlab.com/oblivione/inertiallabs_sdk) for Linux.

The package is tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS & 18.04 LTS  with ROS Kinetic & ROS Melodic . You can install ROS from [here](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu).

## License

* The license for the official SDK is the MIT license which is included in the `ins_ros/inertiallabs_sdk`
* The license for the other codes is Apache 2.0 whenever not specified.

## Compiling

This is a Catkin package. Make sure the package is on `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH` after cloning the package to your workspace. And the normal procedure for compiling a catkin package will work.

```
$ cd <your_work_space>/src
$ $ git clone https://us.inertiallabs.com:31443/scm/ins/inertiallabs-ros-pkgs.git
$ cd <your_work_space>
$ catkin_make_isolated
$ source devel_isolated/setup.bash

```

Why catkin_make_isolated ?

We developed a package for multiple devices with same dependencies , so to avoid confilcts we are compiling using catkin_make_isolated . If you need
to use ins only , So you get the subpackages like inertiallabs_ins , inertiallabs_sdk , intertiallans_msgs and intertiallabs_ros_pkgs to your workspace and use your own build system to compile it . You have to change the intertiallabs_ros_pkgs/intertiallabs_ros_pkgs/package.xml

```

**Node**

example rosnodes


for ins OPVT2AHR packet via USB serial port
```
 rosrun inertiallabs_ins il_ins _ins_url:=serial:/dev/ttyUSB0:460800 _ins_output_format:=88

```
for ins OPVT packet via UDP (INS hostname is used)
```
 rosrun inertiallabs_ins il_ins _ins_url:=udp:INS-F2001234:23 _ins_output_format:=82

```

for ins OPVT packet via UDP (INS IP address is used)
```
 rosrun inertiallabs_ins il_ins _ins_url:=udp:192.168.0.249:23 _ins_output_format:=82

```

## Example Usage

**Parameters**

`ins_url` (`string`, `default: serial:/dev/ttyUSB0:460800`)

Port the device is connected to. Can be serial:[path to device]:[baudrate], tcp:[hostname or address]:[tcp server port], or udp:[hostname or address]:[udp server port]. Inertial Labs Driver supports serial connection

`ins_output_format` (`int`, `82`)

The output data format of the INS data according to IL INS ICD.

## FAQ

1. The driver can't open my serial device?\
Make sure you have ownership of the device in `/dev`.

2. Why I have permission error during the initialization process of the driver?\
Most often, this is because the baud rate you set does not match the package size to be received. Try increase the baud rate.

3. Why is the IMU data output rate much lower than what is set?\
This may be due to a recent change in the FTDI USB-Serial driver in the Linux kernel, the following shell script might help:
    ```bash
    # Reduce latency in the FTDI serial-USB kernel driver to 1ms
    # This is required due to https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/c6dce262
    for file in $(ls /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/); do
      value=`cat /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/$file/latency_timer`
      if [ $value -gt 1 ]; then
        echo "Setting low_latency mode for $file"
        sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/$file/latency_timer"
      fi
    done
    ```
4. Why a field value is always zero?\
Most likely, because this field is not provided in the selected INS data packet. The most versatile data packet is User-Defined Data, which allows to order any set of fields
